#A pass is keyword used in python just to avoid the miss conflict of the function or loop body

for i in range(5):
    pass    #After being using the place holder the error showing will be removed
print("End of the programme")   #here it gives an error bcz of indentation 

# The same will happen in if condition

a = 20
if a <100:
    pass    #After being using the place holder the error showing will be removed
print("End of the programme")   #here it gives an error bcz of indentation
